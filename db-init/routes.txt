🔄 AUTHENTICATION FLOW

User logs in via /auth/login.

Backend verifies credentials in USER table.

System checks the user’s role via:

PATIENT table → patient login

DOCTOR table → doctor login

USER.ROLE = 'ADMIN' → admin login

Returns a JWT token (or session cookie) with the user’s role embedded.

Each protected route checks token + role permissions.
